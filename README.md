# udp-encapsulation-tunnel
Special tunnel programme to encapsulate TCP packets in UDP.

# Logic

- Configuration options; interface, listen-port, and bind-to-interface options are mandatory:

```
--interface tun0
--listen-port 12345
--bind-to-interface wwan1
--endpoint-port 12345

sudo ./udp-encapsulation-tunnel --interface tun0 --listen-port 12345 --bind-to-interface eth0 --endpoint-port 12345
```

- Tunnel programme binds to the interface described on bind-to-interface and listens on UDP port described on listen-port.

## Data RX Path

- Incoming IPv4 packet on bound interface destined to the listened UDP port is delivered to tunnel programme.
- If endpoint-port is not defined, generate a unique IPv4 address from the IPv4 saddr and UDP sport of the packet and store these three as an entry on the "connection_store" structure. There can only be a single entry with the same IPv4 saddr and UDP sport. Remove the entry if it wasn't attempted to be stored in 5 minutes.
- Tunnel programme takes the UDP payload, creates an IPv4 header and puts it on top of the UDP payload. Writes the result to the tunnel interface.
  - IPv4 header details:
    - saddr:
      - If endpoint-port is not defined, IPv4 addr generated from the IPv4 saddr and UDP sport of the packet delivered to tunnel programme.
      - Else, IPv4 saddr on the packet delivered to tunnel programme.
    - daddr: First found IPv4 address assigned to the tunnel interface.
    - Protocol: TCP.

## Data TX Path

- Outgoing IPv4 packet on tunnel interface (tun) is delivered to tunnel programme.
- Discard the packet if it's not a TCP packet or if the IP header length is more than 20 bytes.
- If endpoint-port is not defined, look for an entry on the "connection_store" structure by using the IPv4 daddr on this packet. If there isn't an entry found, discard the packet.
- Tunnel programme removes the IPv4 header from the IPv4 packet. Sends it as an outgoing UDP packet on the bound interface.
  - IPv4 header details:
    - saddr: Decided by kernel by consulting the relevant routing table.
    - daddr:
      - If endpoint-port is not defined, IPv4 addr on the "connection_store" structure found from IPv4 daddr on the packet delivered to tunnel programme.
      - Else, IPv4 daddr on the packet delivered to tunnel programme.
  - UDP header details:
    - sport: Decided by kernel, which is the port defined on the listen-port option.
    - dport:
      - If endpoint-port is not defined, UDP port on the "connection_store" structure found from IPv4 daddr on the packet delivered to tunnel programme.
      - Else, port defined on the endpoint-port option.

# Future Logic With Authentication

## Authentication

- If endpoint-port is not defined:
  - Listen on TCP at listen-port and wait for remote peers to initiate authentication.
  - If successfully authenticated, generate a unique IPv4 address from the IPv4 saddr and UDP sport of the remote peer and store these three as an entry on the "connection_store" structure. There can only be a single entry with the same IPv4 saddr and UDP sport. Remove the entry if it wasn't attempted to be stored in 5 minutes.
  - Else, end TCP connection.

      - Else, port defined on the endpoint-port option.
